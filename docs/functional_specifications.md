# Functional Specificaiton

## Background
Like pages of a book, each passing storm during the winter builds what we call the snowpack. Different "pages" in the snowpack book (we call them layers) react and change to the overlying weather conditions throughout the winter. Certain conditions cause layers within the snowpack to become unstable. Instabilities in the snowpack are hard to predict and difficult to manage, but are a main component necessary for avalanches to occur. These avalanches can pose risks to transportation, economic resources, property, and recreation in the area. Understanding when snow falls, how much snow falls, how dense that snow is, and the temperature within layers of the snowpack can provide useful information to predict which layers may become unstable. Models can provide us with a tool to see into the snowpack without needing to go into the field to measure these parameters. 

Avalanche forecasts rely on an accurate understanding of internal snowpack properties (temperature, density, etc.) to effectively communicate hazards to transportation and recreation in mountain environments. However, observations of internal snowpack properties are relatively few and far between since they require avalanche professionals to go into the field to take measurements. MoSnoPro-US offers a solution by providing estimates of important snowpack properties in an accessible format. The tool provides near-real time model results from a physically-based 1-D snow model driven by remote weather observations. This provides a way to remotely "see" into the snowpack to track internal snowpack changes that are difficult to capture across a broader area.


## Data Sources

Our data will leverage pandas (dataframes, geoJSONs) and xarray (netCDFs) to be compatiable with our software visualization tool, Streamlit. 

### SUMMA Model Output
The model we will be using is called SUMMA (Structure for Unifying Multiple Model Alternatives). It has a Python wrapper and can be installed as a Python package. See the documentation [here](https://github.com/UW-Hydro/pysumma). In our application, SUMMA is used as a physically-based 1-D snow model that provides output of internal snowpack properties. We will focus on visualizing attributes of snowpack depth, density, and temperature. 
- Weather data acquired from select remote snow telemetry stations throughout Washington located near major recreational areas. 

### SNOTEL Site Metadata
The dataset will be from NRCS (National Resource Conservation Service) SNOTEL (Snow Telemetry) weather stations throughout Washington. We will use a tool called `metloom` to efficiently access this data through their API. See documentation [here](https://metloom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). A map of all the available NRCS SNOTEL sites in the Western United States and Canada is available [here](https://nwcc-apps.sc.egov.usda.gov/imap/).

### 18. Graduate Student #1

**Ash** is a graduate student at UW who has never dabbled in snow sports, having grown up in Hawai'i. Since he has lots of nervous energy, he wants to be able to refresh a page daily to see if his first-ever upcoming group snowshoe trip might be during fair conditions. He wants to interact minimally with the page, relying on visual cues to have a "gut reaction" to snowpack conditions. Normally he works with a lot of data at work (and has a background in data visualization), but this is one thing in his life where he wants to not do no internal data processing. 

---

### 19. Graduate Student #2
**Juan** is a wildlife photographer who often goes on stake-outs for 6-8 hours at a time. He wants to check for stable snowpacks in Eastern Washington, and learn the area's humidity and temperature to prepare appropriate stake-out clothing attire. He wants a simple and concise summary of this information when identifying photography sites. Juan's job does not involve technical data skills (outside of image processing) and thus will appreciate simplicity (but not glossing over important details). 

---

### 20. Communications staff at WSDOT
**Tim** works for WSDOT and has been tasked to design content for the department's newest Instagram post. Since many backcountry skiiers have reached out to ask about safety closures following the bomb cyclone, he needs to find a source of information that he can check regularly without having to wait for results to be generated. He wants a simple overview of the situation where large amounts of snow have accumulated so that he can mark-up his own version of a WA state map to disseminate to non-technical audiences on social media. Tim's role as a front-facing, public communicator does not involve technical data skills. Since he also has no background in weather or safety science, he would also appreciate additional resources (like the Northwest Avalanche Center) that he can consult before making his final communication deliverable. 

---

### 21. Very busy, very stressed parent
**Pav** works two jobs and has been planning to take his 8-year-old daughter out for her first snowboarding adventure of the season. His partner was unexpectedly called away for a work emergency, and so he is unsure if he alone can handle the chaos of an all-day trek to the mountains on top of all the weather uncertainty. He does not have time to call the ski resort (only to be put on hold), so he needs a site he can check easily to get a quick decision aid. Because he has so much to juggle on his daily plate, he is looking for a "single click, immediate information" type of interaction. 

---

### 22. Ski Resort Workers' Union Organizer

**Ellen** organizes the union of ski resort workers at Stevens Pass, a supermajority of which have authorized a strike. They need to identify a high-impact strike time, which should coincide with the busiest weekend of the snow sport season. They need to proxy that traffic data using data from a year ago in conjunction with weather data so they don't actively endanger guests when the snowpack isn't safe. Ellen has a background in data science and is familiar with interpreting graphs that visualize longitudinal data. Ellen would also like to easily share the source data with other organizers who may be more familiar with the subject area.
