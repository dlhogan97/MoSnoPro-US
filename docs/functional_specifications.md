# Functional Specificaiton
## Background
Avalanche forecasts rely on an accurate understanding of internal snowpack properties (temperature, density, etc.) to effectively communicate hazards to transportation and recreation in mountain environments. However, observations of internal snowpack properties are relatively few and far between since they require avalanche professionals to go into the field to take measurements. MoSnoPro-US offers a solution by providing estimates important snowpack properties in an accessible format. The tool provides near-real time model results from a physically-based 1-D snow model driven by remote weather observations. This provides a way to remotely "see" into the snowpack to track internal snowpack changes that are difficult to capture across a broad area. 

## User Profiles

### 1. Data Analyst

**Alex** is a data analyst at a transportation agency. He uses data on snowfall and its impact on road conditions to generate reports for decision-makers. Alex wants an application that simplifies filtering, visualizing, and extracting key patterns from large datasets, such as snowplow performance and accident trends. He has moderate programming skills and prefers an interface with intuitive controls and minimal setup. His primary need is interactive dashboards that help him explore correlations and export visuals for reports.
