# Functional Specificaiton
## Background
Avalanche forecasts rely on an accurate understanding of internal snowpack properties (temperature, density, etc.) to effectively communicate hazards to transportation and recreation in mountain environments. However, observations of internal snowpack properties are relatively few and far between since they require avalanche professionals to go into the field to take measurements. MoSnoPro-US offers a solution by providing estimates important snowpack properties in an accessible format. The tool provides near-real time model results from a physically-based 1-D snow model driven by remote weather observations. This provides a way to remotely "see" into the snowpack to track internal snowpack changes that are difficult to capture across a broad area.
