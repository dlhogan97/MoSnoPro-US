**Brainstorming site infrastructure**
- SUMMA is pulling weather data, but it can also be fed directly into the site (eg, weather, humidity) for users to access
- Front-end should only really have spatial data: color/shape can be determined by specific attributes
- Clicking on the location -> give access to the file where all the data are pulled from, so this wouldn't require a complete re-run when each feature layer is processed
- Feature layers/added components (?):
-   Forecast
-   Real observations (instead of smoothed lines)
- The general view is L-shaped, with a larger bottom rung:
-   Sidebar for map feature layers / model features that want to be shown on the bottom panel
-   Map in the center that has points for stations ("At site X, snow is expected to be Y deep, watch out for [instability at Z-depth], point out layers for concern. Check out NWAC for safety guidelines.) in a type of tl;dr caption

**Component design**
Note: starting next week Dave will look into our repos and assess progress towards completing component specification for each user
See slides for template on how to specify components
At minimum, should include: 
- Name
- What it does
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Components used
- Side effects

## 10-31 
**Use cases**
[] Identify 30 user stories, iterate throughout the next month. Can all be “similar” (10 different kinds of graduate students)
[] Describe relevant use cases
[] Develop component specifications
